# Quantum Feature Selection using QUBO

## Why This Project?
Machine learning models struggle with **high-dimensional data**, where redundant features reduce accuracy. Traditional methods like SelectKBest miss optimal feature subsets. This project uses **Quantum Feature Selection (QFS)** with **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** to enhance feature selection.

## What This Solves for QCI
Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI) focuses on **quantum optimization for AI**. This project extends QCIâ€™s capabilities into **ML pipelines**, potentially integrating into **QBoost 2.0** for real-world applications.

##  Results
| Feature Selection Method | Model Accuracy |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| SelectKBest (Classical) | **81.07%** |
| Quantum Feature Selection (QUBO) | **81.77%** |

##  How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quantum-feature-selection.git
cd quantum-feature-selection
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook QuantumFeatureSelection.ipynb
```

##  Next Steps
- Apply **QUBO-based hyperparameter tuning**.
- Integrate into **hybrid quantum-classical AI workflows**.
- Benchmark on **high-dimensional datasets** for fraud detection & genomics.
